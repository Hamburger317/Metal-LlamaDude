# Metal LlamaDude

Finally after 3 years, the official Planet Hamburger Discord bot is coming to fruition.

Based off the excellent [PyCord](https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord) API wrapper for Discord and hosted using drawings of gay cats.

Metal LlamaDude is the Swiss army knife of Discord bots.

## Using the Bot

1. Create a bot using the [Discord Developer](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html) panel.

2. Create a file containing your bot token.

    ```sh
    echo "YOUR_TOKEN" >> token.txt
    ```

3. Clone the Git repository.

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Hamburger317/Metal-LlamaDude.git
    ```

4. Install dependencies using `pip`.

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. Run the main script.

    ```sh
    python bot.py
    ```
